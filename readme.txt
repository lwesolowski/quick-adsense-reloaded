= Why a Quick AdSense fork? =

Quick Adsense is a great plugin and used by more than 100.000 websites. 
Although is not under maintainance and development for more than 3 years by the original author it is still downloaded hundred times a day.
So i decided to continue the project to make sure the plugin will also work in future with new WordPress versions.

Deprecated functions removed, bugs fixed and new filters and hooks created to make this plugin extensible by third party developers!


= Main Features =

* Import all ads settings from Quick AdSense v. 1.9.2 and convert them into serialized options.
* No revenue sharing from your Google AdSense advertising income.
* Quicktags of Quick Adsense are 100% compatible to Quick AdSense Reloaded
* No external script dependencies. All plugin code reside on your site. 
* Dynamic AdSense positioning: Assign Google AdSense ads to the beginning, middle and end of post, assign dds after 'more' tag, before last paragraph, after certain paragraphs & assign Ads after certain images.
* Insert Google AdSense ads specifically or randomly anywhere within a post.
* Support any Ads code, not limited to Google Adsense dds only.
* Display up to a maximum of 10 Ads on a page. Google TOS allows publishers to place up to 3 Google Adsense for Content on a page. If you are using other dds, you may display up to 10 Ads.
* Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes on Sidebar Widgets.
* Support up to a maximum of 10 Ads codes for specific placement & randomization within a post.
* Insert Google AdSense ads on-the-fly, insert &lt;!--Ads1--&gt;, &lt;!--Ads2--&gt; ... , &lt;!--RndAds--&gt; to a post to accomplish this.
* Disable Ads on-the-fly, insert &lt;!--NoAds--&gt;, &lt;!--OffDef--&gt;, &lt;!--OffWidget--&gt;, &lt;!--OffBegin--&gt; ... and more to a post to accomplish this.
* The above quicktags can be inserted into a post easily via the additional Quicktag Buttons added to the HTML Edit Post SubPanel.

= Improvements to original Quick AdSense Ads plugin =

* Performance improvements
* Serialized storing of Ad options instead storing every single option as separate table entry all over
* Multi language support
* Remove of small coding issues like "unexpected output" message when plugin is activated on several sites
* Import / Export function makes plugin migrating to other sites easier. Copy your dds code to other sites.

= Safety improvements = 

* Exit code if Quick AdSense plugin is not called by WordPress directly 
* Better sanitizing of user input


@todo:

* Support for responsive Google AdSense ads
* GUI improvements

Do you have suggestions for more features?

= High Performance =

Quick AdSense Reloaded is *coded well and developed for high performance*.
It loads only the code it needs at the moment of execution, making it small and fast and with a lot of hooks easy extensible by third party developers.
